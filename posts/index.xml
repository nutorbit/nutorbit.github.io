      <description>If you pay attention to everything around you, you will notice that graphs are everywhere. It is natural to represent many things as graphs. For example, a social network can be represented as a graph where the nodes are people and the edges are friendships. Molecules can be represented as graphs where the nodes are atoms and the edges are chemical bonds.
Tackle the problem of learning from graph structure with traditional methods requires a lot of domain knowledge and spend most of the time on data preprocessing.</description>
